## Purpose

The purpose of this lab is to use Internal Border Gateway Protocol (iBGP) to share routes in and out of an autonomous system (AS) by establishing iBGP neighborships. Additionally, eBGP will be used to share route information between the other two AS’s. As a part of this lab, knowledge about using route-reflectors, declaring iBGP neighbors, and using an interior gateway protocol (IGP) to help BGP packets get navigated between iBGP neighbors will be integral to setting up iBGP. For eBGP, skills about how to redistribute routes and how to use eBGP to route between AS’s will be important for this lab.

## Lab Summary

In this lab 3 AS’s were set up with eBGP connecting the 3 AS’s together. There are two host devices that are PCs and there are seven 4321 routers that are connected via ethernet. To allow host devices to communicate with each other, the routers needed IPv6 and IPv4 routes to redistribute in and out of eBGP. Additionally in the 2nd AS, iBGP is used to provide network connectivity between AS 1 and AS 3 with EIGRP serving as the routing protocol for the 2nd AS.

In the topology, R7—the router in the middle of the 2nd AS—acts as a route-reflector to neighbors: R3 and R4. This allows R7 to receive routes from R3 and R4, so that connectivity can be established between the 2 AS’s. And when R7 receives routes, it will send updates to R3 and R4, which will provide end-to-end connectivity for the PCs.

## Topology

These are the topologies for both IPv4 and IPv6, each link is labeled with the network number and subnet mask of the link. Then each interface is labeled with the 4th octet of the usable IP address within the subnet of that link.\
Additionally, the PCs can have any IP that is within the subnet of the link that they are on. **DHCP is not setup**.
